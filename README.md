# Cricket-Ball-Tracking
This project presents a ball tracking technique that detects and follows a pink ball in test cricket video frames using color segmentation, contour analysis, and Kalman filtering. The approach provides accurate, frame-by-frame estimation of the ball’s position and predicted trajectory in real time, utilizing fundamental image processing methods.
